Hey there,

I'm a free software developer, originally from Germany, now backpacking around the globe.
So if you're interested in ramblings about programming language design, Lisp, Rust, JS/TS then you've come to the right place.

Regarding the format of the blog: I'm trying to make it a habit to write every day about my various projects and my thoughts
regarding the technologies used, sometimes interspersed with personal stuff.
