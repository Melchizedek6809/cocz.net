Hey there,

I'm a free software developer, originally from Germany and now traveling around the globe, writing (mostly) Free Software in various Cafe's.
So if you're interested in ramblings about programming language design, Lisp, Rust, JS/TS then you've come to the right place.

Regarding the format of the blog: I'm trying to make it a habit to write every day about the various projects I'm working on and my thoughts
regarding the technologies used, sometimes interspersed with personal stuff.
