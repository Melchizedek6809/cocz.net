So, I've finally become one of these digital nomad backpackers,
floating through Asia with neither purpose nor goals.

While it is pretty nice get to see so many different places and cultures it
does become a bit weird after a bit to not really have a home, a place
to relax. While I've been struggling with a missing purpose these last
couple of weeks and since I'm not one to just enjoy hedonistic pleasures
all day, I though I'd do what I like most, do some coding!

However, this time I kind of want to try something different, since in the
past most projects just ended up going on forever while I work on some
low-level things that in the end don't matter at all if there's nobody
using that program.

This has mostly been brought about because I realized that of the games
I've made, the only one I've seen other people actually like/enjoy was
a [game I made for a GameJam in a week](https://melchizedek6809.itch.io/a-certain-magical-shooter),
while other games I've [spent months](https://github.com/wolkenwelten/wolkenwelten-ts)
or [even years](https://github.com/wolkenwelten/wolkenwelten-c) on don't really evoke anything
in playtesters. This mostly came about because some of the kids I've been
teaching GameDev in a Youth Center started playing that game by themselves
and getting quite competitive about it, at first they weren't sure whether
one can actually beat that game because it's too hard, after showing them that it's
possible things started heating up until the first beat it, gotta say it was really
nice to see people actually enjoying something I made!

With that experience in mind, I'll build a couple of apps in the future to just
try out various ideas, trying to keep things as simple as possible, and not just
spend months obsessing over technicalities that are irrelevant without a sufficiently
big userbase. This also seems like a nice opportunity to try out different stacks and
see with which one I get results the easiest/fastest, trying to keep an open mind and
not just write off because it's too hip or something.

This all can be boiled down into a couple of rules/constraints I'll put on myself,
since constraint begets creativity.

1. 7 Days from start to finish! (can be non-consecutive)
2. Don't add anything new after Day 3, unless absolutely necessary!
3. Write about the process, from start to finish including screenshots/thrown away ideas
4. Make it Open-Source (probably AGPLv3)
5. Actually tell people about it!


Especially that last part will be quite the challenge for me, but in the end people will
either like it or just ignore or forget about it.

So, for a first project I'm working on social app, matching people that want to learn something
with people that are willing to teach that. Nothing fancy, might already exist, but seems simple
enough for a first project.

Regarding the tech stack I'll try out Astro/React/Tailwind/Material Tailwind/Supabase, I'm
especially interested in Supabase, since if it works out it could simplify things greatly and
Material Tailwind looks like a nice component library so that I spend my time actually building
the app, instead of designing another button component.

Well, that was quite the brain-dump, hope you enjoyed reading it.
It's currently 2:38AM here in Busan and I gotta wake up somewhat early tomorrow since I'm getting
lunch with friends.
