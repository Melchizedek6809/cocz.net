Finally set up a blog, this time using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) instead of going down the rabbit-hole of writing a custom SSG (which get's even more time intensive if it's written in a custom language). I'll mostly write about various tech related things that I thing about since it allows me to go back to see how I thought in the past, and also solidify my thinking as I'm writing the entry.
